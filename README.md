# cs50
Hello everyone, this is my repository for the cs50 course. Here, I decided to post my code and homework tasks during my completion of this course.

To run any code from this repo you will need to install [MinGW toolkit](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw)(which stands for Minimalist GNU for Windows) for work with GCC(GNU Compiler Collection) (if you are running on windows, on linux and macOS GCC is usually installed by default) and used for creating a windows applications, and the [cs50 library for C](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/libraries/cs50/c/) which adds some useful tools.

I posted my code for the Python code language using SQL, hence I dont mentioned the files from the week 6(Python), 7(SQL) and 8(html, css, js) ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—.
